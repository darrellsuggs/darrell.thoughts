If you have never been to GalaxyCon, you should go.  Trust me.

**Galaxy What?**

This is the eastern seboards version of the infamous "ComicCon". Nominally, a "Anime Convention" maybe?

**How Did I Get Here?**

I'll confess that I have begun to enjoy the annual sojourn.

**Star Struck**

A couple of years back, my youngest and I paid to have a photo with Chrisotpher Lloyd (Doc Brown from Back to the Future -- an all=time favorite movie of mine.)  It was expensive and quick, but cool just to be there.

This year I happened upon one of my favorite TV characters -- Data from Star Trek The Next Generation. We spoke for a while.  He was really laid back and funny actually.  I paid for a photo.  I asked AI to render it for me from the original.
