Vacation travel is fun, but complicated. (8)

My wife and I have always valued vacations.  Before kids, we took our first cruise (in a very, very small cabin), spent a week in Cancun (the taxi driver called us the “loco americanos”), visited Reno, Portland, Vail, and Germany.  

As parents we have taken the kids all over the planet.  From Disney in Florida to Disney in Los Angeles.  From NYC to San Francisco.  We’ve traveled internationally: Australia, Paris, Mexico, Bahamas and Virgin Islands, and even Canada.  For us travel has always been an important experience.

For us, travel has always been an important and valuable experience.  That holds true today -- we still travel as a family of five occasionally.  Not often, but sometimes we can make it happen.  A couple of years ago we snorkeled as a family off the coast of Honduras -- and caught Covid together as an added surprise.

**Nerd Math**

Over the years I’ve developed a basic math formula for the complexity of travel (and of life in general really).  Here it is:

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1}
$$

$$
\text{where } N = \text{number of people}
$$

In this context complexity can mean several things -- stress or cost or even just moments of “grumpiness”.

Let’s look at examples of how this works.  For instance if I travel alone for some reason (occasionally for business) then N = 1.  In this case the formula says

$$
\text{N} = 1, \text{ (i.e. just me)} 
$$

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1} = 2^{(1) - 1} = 2^0 = 1 
$$

So the complexity of traveling alone is the base value of 1.
This is low complexity; eat when I'm hungry, sleep when I'm tired, travel light, move fast.
But to be honest, this is not that much fun.  It's work, not vacation.
But the complexity is low.

**N = 2**

Now, consider a trip like we are on as I write this.  My wife and I on a cruise.  
No kids, no dogs, no computers -- you get the idea.
In this case, N = 2, so the formula is 

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1} = 2^{(2) - 1} = 2^1 = 2 
$$

Two of us traveling is twice the one person complexity.  Not bad, and a lot more fun than traveling alone for work.
In this case, just two of us on a cruise, the hardest part is in getting to the point where we can travel.
Dogs, work, houses, teenager, and other demands are hard to get lined up.
It usually requires our oldest, bless her soul, to bend her life in half to enable this to happen.
That was the case this trip too - and we are so very grateful to her.  Thank you to our oldest baby girl.

**N > 2**
Back to the math of travel.  Here are several more data points.
Consider a simple trip with me, my wife, and our teenager -- N = 3.

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1} = 2^{(3) - 1} = 2^2 = 4 
$$
