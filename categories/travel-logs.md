description: "My wife and I have always loved and prioritized travel.  Our first big trip as a couple was Cancun Mexico in 1990.  Since then we have traveled more places than we can remember.  We instilled a love of traveling with our children early.  The older two have now traveled the world individually and without us.  The third has been to five countries outside the US and all over the continent.  Travel can be a fun adventure for us all.  Nothing, however, is easy or free - hence travel.logs."
