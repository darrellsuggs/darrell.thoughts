description: "First line of code for money: 1982.  Four decades in the industry: PhD in computer science, 10 different tech companies, promoted, laid off, individual contributor, team lead, and tech advisor to vice presidents.  Mentored hundreds, helped make movies, and solved stock trading problems.  Programmed in over 30 languages, written millions of lines of code, worked for a company of 350,000 and was employee number 42 at a dot com start-up.  My career arc has been long, complicated, and at times chaotic."
