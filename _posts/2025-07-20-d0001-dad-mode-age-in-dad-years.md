I am 131 in dad years -- and I feel it.

What are dad years?  My theory is that dads do not age at the normal rate of everyone else.  
This measure is calculated not only by your age, but also by the number of years you have been a dad.
And not just "I've had kids for 30 years" -- it matters how many kids and the years are counted serially, not in parallel (yeah, nerd.brain).

For example, here is the math for my age in dad years:
- 58: my current age 
- 32: age of the oldest 
- 28: age of the middle child 
- 13: age of the youngest

So my total age is 58 + 32 + 28 + 13 = 131 dad years.

Yes, 131 -- and some days I feel everyone of them.

Why is this true?  What causes this accelerated aging factor?  Can I reverse it?

First, being dad doesn't just mean fathering a child.
To me, being dad means being there -- every day, every event, every problem, every need.
The dad is the rock that everyone can rest on when needed and hold onto in a storm.
That's what being a dad means to me.

But that also means that the dad experiences every year for every child.
And every child is different.  In my case *radically* different.
So whatever technique, or skill, or solution I develop for one has *no* bearing on the others.
Even the same challenges require different solutions for different kids.

Additionally, every phase is new.  What your four year-old needs is not the same as your fourteen year old.
And what your thirty-something needs is radically different than what she needed as a teenager.
The problems get different and harder as time goes on.  No two problems are the same, no two kids are the same.

And as the kids get older, the problems and solutions become more impactful, longer term, and more permanent.
Picking a college, picking a career, picking a spouse -- all of these are hard problems that can benefit from guidance but are lifelong decisions.

On top of everything, the control knobs for being the parent become fewer and fewer over time.
Plus they become less responsive.  You can put a four year old in timeout.  You can take the keys from a young driver.  But what do you do about a nineteen year old who is on the other side of the planet?  Can't just give up.  Can't just look the other way.  Have to develop new dad skills on the fly, under pressure, with no training.  Age++.

Yet, in the face of all these challenges, your desires as a dad remain the same.
You want to protect them, help them grow, support them, catch them when they stumble, and love them.
Just be that rock, no matter what the circumstances.

Perhaps most challenging is that the role of dad does *not* come with a handbook -- you just have to figure it out as you go.  Someone should really fix that.

Until then, I'll just keep racking up the dad years -- I'm at 131 now, but shooting for at least 200.
