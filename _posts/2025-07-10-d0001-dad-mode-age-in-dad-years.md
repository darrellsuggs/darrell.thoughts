I am 131 in dad years -- and I feel it.

What are dad years?  This is calculated not only by your age, but also by the number of years you have been a dad.
And not just "I've had kids for 30 years" -- it matters how many kids and the years are counted serially, not in parallel (yeah, nerd.brain).

Here is the math for me:
- my current age (58)
- age of the oldest (32)
- age of the middle child (28)
- age of the youngest (13)

So my total age is 58 + 32 + 28 + 13 = 131 dad years

- why?  every kid is different.  every phase is new.
- problems get harder.  decisions are more impactful.
- control knobs are fewer and often unresponsive
- yet desires stay true.  protect.  grow.  support. love
