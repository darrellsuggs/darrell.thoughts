Vacation travel is fun, but the math makes it complicated.

My wife and I have always valued vacations.  Before kids, we took our first cruise (in a very, very small cabin), spent a week in Cancun (the taxi driver called us the “loco americanos”), visited Reno, Portland, Vail, NYC, and Germany.  

As parents we have taken the kids all over the planet.  From Disney in Florida to Disney in Los Angeles.  From NYC to San Francisco.  We’ve traveled internationally: Australia, Paris, Mexico, Bahamas and Virgin Islands, and even Canada.  For us travel has always been an important experience.

That holds true today -- we still travel as a family of five occasionally.  Not often, but sometimes we can make it happen.  A couple of years ago we snorkeled as a family off the coast of Honduras -- and caught Covid together as an added surprise.

**Nerd Math**

Over the years I’ve developed a basic math formula for the complexity of travel (and of life in general really).  Here it is:

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1}
$$

$$
\text{where } N = \text{number of people}
$$

In this context complexity can mean several things -- stress or cost or even just moments of “grumpiness”.

Let’s look at examples of how this works.  For instance if I travel alone for some reason (occasionally for business) then **N = 1**.  In this case the formula says

$$
\text{N} = 1, \text{ (i.e. just me)} 
$$

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1} = 2^{(1) - 1} = 2^0 = 1 
$$

So the complexity of traveling alone is the base value of 1.
This is low complexity; eat when I'm hungry, sleep when I'm tired, travel light, move fast.
But to be honest, this is not that much fun.  It's work, not vacation.
But the complexity is low.

**N = 2**

Consider a trip like the one we are on as I write this.  My wife and I on a cruise.  
No kids, no dogs, no computers -- you get the idea.
In this case, **N = 2**, so the formula is 

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1} = 2^{(2) - 1} = 2^1 = 2 
$$

Two of us traveling is twice the one person complexity.  Not bad, and a lot more fun than traveling alone for work.
In this case, just two of us on a cruise, the hardest part is in getting to the point where we can travel.
Dogs, work, houses, teenager, and other demands are hard to get lined up.
It usually requires our oldest, bless her soul, to bend her life in half to enable this to happen.
That was the case this trip too - and we are so very grateful to her.  Thank you to our oldest baby girl.

**N > 2**

Back to the math of travel.  Here are several more data points.
Consider a simple trip with me, my wife, and our teenager: **N = 3**.

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1} = 2^{(3) - 1} = 2^2 = 4 
$$

So this is twice as complex as just me and my wife, and four time as complex as single travel.
And this is not a reflection on the added person.
The math is the same regardless of the actual people traveling.
Why? Easy really.  With three people, at any given moment, someone is probably hungry, 
someone needs to use the restroom, someone is tired and a little irritable.
Additionally, there is more luggage, more stuff, more trash, etc.  It's just more complex.

Now, let's look at the five family members data point: **N = 5**.

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1} = 2^{(5) - 1} = 2^4 = 16 
$$

Traveling as a family of five can be 16 times more complicated than traveling alone,
and 8 times more than going as a couple.  For instance, since there are only two of us on this cruise,
I have time to sit in the shade near the pool and pen this writing while my better half enjoys the sun.
This has been rolling around in my head for years while I've wanted to write it down, but life (even on 
vacation as a family) makes it hard to find the time.

**Bring Them All**

Consider an extreme travel situation: **N = 8**.
In our case that's five humans and three dogs.  We do it, but not often.  Here's why.

$$
\text{N} = 8, \text{ (5 humans + 3 dogs)}
$$

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1} = 2^{(8) - 1} = 2^7 = 128
$$

That's **64 times** more complicated than traveling as a couple.
Kind of helps me understand the appeal of an empty nest, lol.
We don't do this often, usually only during the holidays, and for good reason.

So, what am I saying? <u>Not</u> that I dislike travel as a family - my wife and I both love it and do it as often as we can.
It <u>does</u> mean that I think about, plan, and execute a family trip differently than a couple-only trip.  Both are great and different in many ways.
We travel as a family if we can, but this gets harder as the older kids have their own lives and schedules.
And we travel just as a couple on the rare occasion when we can pull it off.  I enjoy both, in very different ways.

Why write about this?  Because I can (recall we are on a husband/wife cruise).
Because it's been in my head and trying to get out for years.  And, perhaps most importantly, because understanding the math and preparing appropriately for the complexity makes me a better travel mate.

**Life Complexity**

The final reason to write about this is because I realize the math applies to non-vacation life too.
Here is the modified version.

<div style="margin: 0 auto; width: max-content; text-align: left;">

<p><strong>Daily Stress</strong> = \(2^{N-1}\), where <strong>N</strong> is...</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
  <li>\(\#\) of people you care about</li>
  <li>\(\#\) of jobs involved</li>
  <li>\(\#\) of cars, houses, dogs</li>
  <li>\(\#\) of other “big things”</li>
</ul>

</div>

In a daily situation, there might be five people, three dogs, four cars, two jobs, meals, school work,
medical appointments, blah, blah, blah.  The stress and complexity can be **huge**:

$$
2^{N - 1} \text{ if N = 10} \rightarrow \mathbf{1{,}024}
$$

And some days it feels that way too.

That's why we travel when we can.  Even the entire family trips are less complex than
daily life - since we leave a lot of **N's** at home.

**Lessons Learned**
- Travel as often as possible -- life is short, make sure you enjoy it.
- Travel with the whole clan when possible, but make some N=2 trips happen too.
- Be a great travel mate by understanding the math and planning accordingly.
