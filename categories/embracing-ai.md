description: "The age of artificial intelligence has arrived.  Consider for a moment other earth shattering technology shifts.  From the typewriter to a word processor.  From encyclopedias to google.  From land lines to smart phones.  Each of these pale in comparison to the AI transition -- from *thinking alone* to *thinking with AI*.  That is the AI revolution.  Ignore it, fear it, love it, or hate it -- we can't stop it.  The genie has left the bottle."
