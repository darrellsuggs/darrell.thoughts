I am not an artist. Not even close. Even my stick figures are pretty bad. I guess that part of my brain just doesn’t work right.

Back in 1999, my wife made a simple little piece of artwork for the front of a homemade notebook I carried around at work (for years). The image was a guy who looked like his hair was on fire—kind of how I felt during much of my professional life. I recently came across that old notebook in a box while decluttering. Here’s the image. I think of it as a younger version of myself.

When I got a reMarkable tablet in early 2021, I recreated the drawing from memory—with my very non-artistic hand. It’s been the cover of my “Home To Do” notebook ever since.

This guy’s hair still looks on fire, but now he seems a little older, a little calmer, a little less deer-in-the-headlights. I’ve been happy with it.

Working on this blog made me want a new version of my hair-on-fire guy as the author avatar. So I uploaded that second picture into ChatGPT (yep, it accepts images now) and gave it this prompt:

"artwork. I'm going for a cleaned up, but still off-the-cuff version of this pic. make the glasses a little more round and the face a little older. but keep the same vibe and the same simplicity."
Seconds later—literally about six seconds—the AI artist returned this:

<p align="center"> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/a0001-03.png" alt="Me thinking" width="150"> </p>
Not bad at all. I followed up with:

"I like that. can you also give it somewhat of a mullet, but still with the simple style and look of this one?"
And got this in return:

Wow. That one instantly resonated with me. I love it.

Think about it—just two minutes, a total non-artist, some stick-figure doodles, and a couple of simple prompts. That’s all it took to create a new, distinctive, and surprisingly cool piece of custom art.

The truth is, OpenAI’s ChatGPT art and design skills are phenomenal. This is just one simple but powerful example of what AI brings to the world of visual creativity. Using AI as an agreeable and talented companion gives all of us a way to become artists.

And now I’ve got a new avatar for the next decade or two.
