It is scary to chose to leave a job.  Not choosing to leave is worse.

I voluntarily left my job of three years at IBM Cloud recently.
My choice, my timing, my plan.  The last time it happened that way I was also leaving IBM - 25 years ago.

Long ago, after a six year tenure at Data General Corp (my first corporate empoyer), I left voluntarily and joined IBM. 

**IBM: 2 Learning Years**

The IBM tenure was about two years.  For decades I joked that it "was about 1.5 years too long".  It was not a good fit.  There was a lot learned about what NOT to have in a job.  I made a plan and exited myself on my terms.

**iSharp.com: <1 Year DotCom Bomb**

iSharp.com - a dotcom startup - was my next target.  I had 90,000 stock options and dotcom dollar signs in my eyes.  I was there for about nine months.  Hard at work one Friday afternoon but then the  company shutdown completely on the next Monday morning.  Just one of many, many companies to suffer the dotcom bubble burst. I was out of work, and not by my choice.

**NetApp: 12 Good Years, 3 Not So Much**

Network Appliance (NetApp) brought me on as one of the last engineers hired for a couple of years.  I felt the wind of the door slamming shut behind me on my backside.  I was there for 15 years.  I should have left at the 12 year mark -- my happiness and value add was no longer there.  But, I over stayed my welcome (because it was the easy path).  I was laid off on their terms.  That stung.

**Simplivity: 3 Good Years**

Simplivity, a startup of about 800 employees, was next.  After being there a year we were acquired by HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) -- probably not a company I would have looked at otherwise.  Two years later HPE shutdown Simplivity. Most were laid off, but I was force marched to another division, Nimble.  I was happy not to be let go, but Nimble wasn't a place or role I would have sought out on my own.

**Nimble: 1 Meh Year**

Nimble was not a good fit.  Both me and management could tell.  I was there a year and exited myself -- but it was going to happen one way or another. I left, but not completely on my terms -- just given the chance to pull the trigger myself.

**Cohesity: 1 Toxic Year**

Cohesity, another multi-hundred employee startup was next (I guess I'm a slow learner).  For the first time in my professional career I experienced an incredibly toxic environment and an even more toxic management.  I left on my own, but my really poor manager was pushing.  This was a more brutal experience than being booted by NetApp to be honest. The experience really had a toll on me personally and professionally.

The ensuing interview cycle was brutal.  I hadn't really interviewed aggressively in over six years.  The landscape had changed.  Drastically. The interview process is incredible (topic for another place).  I was told "no thanks" by three of the biggest tech companies.  Not an easy thing.

**IBM: 3 Great Years**

I eventually landed offers from Dell and IBM -- old school companies really.  IBM was the smart choice.  For three years I reloaded my skills for the cloud age, in a very reasonable enviornment.  A nice respite really from the previous decade of turmoil.

Making the choice to leave IBM was professionally very difficult.  Leaving good opportunity, great work, and a top notch manager behind is hard.
However, it was absolutely the right thing to do at the right time.  Making the choice was still a little scary.  The only thing worse would be not choosing to leave.

**Oracle: TBD**

Check back in a couple of years ...

**Lessons**

- Manage your own career or no one else will.  Worse yet, it may manage you. 
- If you are unhappy in a place you used to be happy, accept the change and move on.
- The best time to find a new job is when you already have one -- even if you are mostly happy.
