description: "Life happens right in front of you, in real time.  Moment by moment, event by event.  The trick is to learn how to live it, love it, and appreciate it right in the moment it happens.  Not regretting yesterday, or fretting tomorrow, but living today as best you can with the excitement and curiosity of a child.  This means seeing people, places, things, and events for what they really are, what they really mean, and how they impact you and the world around you.  Philosophy mixed with a heavy dose of in the moment -- life unfolds in front of you."
