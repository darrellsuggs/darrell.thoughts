description: "Marriage is a life long commitment to compromise and shared sacrifice -- a complicated and ever evolving dance.  Like two people riding on a motorcyle, holding each other, trusting each other, leaning in and out together - not in opposition, and enjoying the ride - sometimes fast, sometimes curvy - absorbing the sun and weathering the rain.  The moments are not always easy but they are always ours."
