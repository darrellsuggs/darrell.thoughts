description: "Marriage is a life long commitment to compromise and shared sacrifice.  Like two people on a motorcyle, trusting each other, leaning in and out togehter - not in opposition, holding each other, and enjoying the ride - sometimes fast, sometimes slow, loving the wind and weathering the rain.  Married moments."
