If you have never been to GalaxyCon, you should go.  Trust me.

**Galaxy What?**

GalaxyCon is the eastern seaboard's version of the infamous San Diego "ComicCon". Nominally, an "Anime Convention", but that name doesn't do justice to the event.  It happens annually in late July in the Raleigh, NC convention center - a four day event.

The event is attended by thousands each day, young kids to the elderly.  It brings a large and diverse crowd. You really do have to see it to understand, but I'll explain what I can.

**What Is It - Really**

After several visits, I've come to better understand the outlines of the event.  I'll summarize.
- Celebrity Meet/Greet/Photo and Q&A
- Giant Bazaar (Everything from real swords to custom artwork)
- Costume Contests (For yound and old)
- Cosplay Spectacle (You just have to see it to understand)

**Celebrities**

There are typically 50 or more celebrities.  Some well known actors, some voice actors, some wrestling personalities, and a whole host of voice and little known actors.

They each have a booth for autographs, selfies, and chatting.  In my experience most of them are just down to earth  people, basking in the glow of fans, chatting, signing, and smiling for photos with each fan.  And collecting a little money for the effort (typically $60 or so for a photo with the fan.)

I usually just cruise the rows, looking for people who I'm familiar with and then stealig a glance in real life.  Occasionally I'll walk up and chat briefly (if they are sitting idle).  Only twice have I paid for pictures. But it's an interesting group, lots of big screen movie stars as well as streaming and televison personalities.  I've seen everyone from Ric Flair (the wrestler) to Linda Hamilton (the woman in Terminator). Oddly enough, in real life, they typically look older and less glamorous -- natural I suppose. Just seeing them in real life is cool.

**Giant Market**

The convention center floor is turned into a humongous bazaar, cut into rows and columns.  The vendors sell a very diverse set of products.  There is a lot of artwork and posters.  Funko pops, trading cards, swords, pins, and a wide arrange of "toys" like Lego people and video game stuff.

There is also a large contingent of custom artists.  Graphic novelists, full fledged writers, and artists of all ilk's, from paitinings to incredible pencil stenciling.  After seeing what celebs are there, I usually walk each and every aisle looking at the merchandise (and the people).  I find the artists and writers are very approachable and quick to offer insight into their work.  I'm always fascinated with both the skill and mechanics needed to craft their art.  This year one guy pre-answered one of my most common questions by putting a sticker on each pencil drawing showing "Hours Invested". One drawing had 200 hours - that's five normal work weeks.  Custom artwork is clearly time consuming.

Over the time I've been going, I've noticed a shift away from some of the more well known themes (Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc) toward numerous (unrecognizable to me) variations of Asian and Anime. That said, if you need a full body Storm Trooper outfit, this is your place.

**Costume Contests**

There is an apparently very impressive set of adult costume competitions.  We haven't seen those yet.  But perhaps next year, since the age group is 14 and up.

This year our daughter dressed up in a self-assembled and homemade costume (of some character I still don't know, lol).  Her and two friends entered the 13 and under costume competition.  There were probably 80 entries, and a spectator crowd of 500.  The girls didn't win, but they had their moment on stage to show their cosplay costume and poses.  It was fun.

**Cosplay Spectacle**

Let me explain cosplay this way.  Recall a time in life when you loved Halloween and creating the perfect costume to show off with your friends and neighbors was almost as exciting as Christmas. Now, become an adult, have a budget with real money, and build your perfect costume of your favorite character.  Now stroll around a building with thousands of other cosplay characters, taking pictures with them and sharing complements about the outfits.  Better yet, bump into someone dressed as you, fanboy and take pictures togther.  Again, I cannot overstate this part -- you just have to see some of these cosplay outfits in person.

**How Did I Get Here?**

I am not a Cosplayer -- I didn't even know the word until a couple of years ago.

About seven years ago, our oldest daughter introduced our youngest daugther to the "Comicon" concept.  They went jointly together after than for several years.  Then the older daughter had an adult life and job and found herself out of town several years in a row.  Since our youngest had decided this was a "must-do activity", I volunteered to take her and some friends over.  That was three years ago I think - I have attened all three since then.  I whine and moan about it a little (it's not cheap, we usually use up a Sunday afternoon doing it, crowded, lots of walking, July, ... you get the picture). But, I'll confess that I have begun to enjoy the annual sojourn.


**Star Struck**

A couple of years back, my youngest and I paid to have a photo with Chrisotpher Lloyd (Doc Brown from Back to the Future -- an all-time favorite movie of mine.)  It was expensive and quick, but cool just to be there.

This year as I wandered around I came across a couple of interesting people.  

First was a woman whose sign said she was the voice actor for Princess Peach (from Nintendo Mario fame -- a genre I still love and play occasionally.)  Her booth had no fans, so I casually walked up and said "You know, I've saved you a BUNCH of times" -- witty I thought, but probably the millionth time she has heard it.  I was then quite surprised when she said back "Thank you for saving me" -- in **Princess Peach's** voice.  That is really how she sounds in her normal speaking.  It was simply surreal.

I also came across a life size and clearly realistic R2-D2. No way to pass that up.  I asked for a selfie and he obliged -- no charge.  Next time I saw him I finally spotted the guy with the remote controls -- he was a normal looking guy in a crowd of cosplayers.  But the R2-D2 effect was just fun.

There were a couple of celebs that I stalked a little, the young boy from Jurassic Park (again a favorite of mine) and the programmer who was stealing the dinosaur DNA in a shaving cream can.  They had aged considerably -- Jurassic Park was 1993.

**Old Guy Syndrome**

The last "famous" person I talked to was Sid Kroft, creator of one of my favorite Saturday morning shows "Land of the Lost" (I still recall those scary Sleastak things).  He was creator on several other shows too.  His booth was empty, so I pointed out my childhood favorite and we talked for about 10 minutes about the show.  Interesting and free.  No Sleastaks involved.

I do sometimes feel my age when making the rounds.  There will be a celeb with a hundred people queued up to meet them.  I'll look at the name and photo and think "who the heck is that?"  This elicits and eyeroll from the 13 year old.

**Data**

The highlight this year was when I also happened upon one of my favorite TV characters -- Data from Star Trek The Next Generation (Brent Spiner). His booth had no line, so I walked up and we spoke for a while.  He was really laid back and funny actually.  I paid for a photo.  I asked AI to render it for me from the original.

**Summary Thoughts**
- Occasionally, explore a subculture completely out of your wheelhouse.
- Celebrities are just people too, most of them nice and down to earth.
- Custom artwork is especially interesting when the artist is standing in front of you.
- Creativity and passion comes in many forms -- Cosplay is certainly one of those.
- It's possible to be dad, nerd, and writer -- all in one day. I like it.
