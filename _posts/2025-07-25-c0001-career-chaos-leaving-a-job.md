It is scary to chose to leave a job.  Not choosing to leave is worse.
I am not an artist. But AI is here for me.

I voluntarily left my job of three years at IBM Cloud today.
My choice, my timing, my plan.  The last time it happened that way I was also leaving IBM - 25 years ago.

After a six year stent at Data General Corp, I joined IBM. I was there for about two years.  For decades I joked that it "was about 6 months too long".  It was not a good fit.  I made a plan and exited myself on my terms.

iSharp.com - a dotcom startup - was my target.  I had 90,000 options and dotcom dollar signs in my eyes.  I was there for about nine months.  Hard at work one Friday afternoon, company shutdown completely on the next Monday morning.  Just one of many to suffer the dotcom bubble burst. I was out of work, and not by my choice.

Network Appliance (NetApp) brought me on as one of the last engineers hired for a couple of years.  I could feel the wind of the door on my backside.  I was there for 15 years.  I should have left three years earlier -- my happiness and value add was no longer there.  But, I over stayed my welcome (because it was the easy path).  I was laid off on their terms.  That stung.

Simplivity, a startup of about 800 employees, was next.  After being there a year we were acquired by HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) -- probably not a company I would have looked at otherwise.  Two years later HPE shutdown Simplivity. Most were laid off, but I was force marched to another division, Nimble.  I was happy not to be let go, but Nimble wasn't a place or role I would have sought out on my own.

Nimble was not a good fit.  Both me and management could tell.  I was there a year and exited myself -- but it was going to happen one way or another. I left, but not completely on my terms -- just given the chance to pull the trigger myself.

Cohesity, another multi-hundred employee startup was next (I guess I'm a slow lerner, lol).  For the first time in my professional career I experienced an incredibly toxic environment and an even more toxic management.  I left on my own, but my really poor manager was pushing.  This was a more brutal experience than being booted by NetApp to be honest.

The ensuing interview cycle was brutal.  I hadn't really interviewed aggressively in over six years.  Boy did the landscape change.  The interview process is incredible (topic for another place).  I was told "no thanks" by three of the biggest tech companies.  

I eventually landed offers from Dell and IBM -- old school companies really.  IBM was the smart choice.  For three years I reloaded my skills for the cloud age, in a very reasonable enviornment.  A nice respite really from the previous decade of turmoil.

Making the choice to leave IBM was professionally very difficult.  Leaving good opportunity, great work, and a top notch manager behind is hard.
However, it was absolutely the right thing to do at the right time.  Making the choice was still a little scary.  The only thing worse would be not choosing to leave.

Lesson: manager your career or no one will.  Worse yet, it may manage you.
