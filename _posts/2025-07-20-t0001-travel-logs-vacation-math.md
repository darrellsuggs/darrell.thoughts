Vacation travel is fun, but complicated. (3)

My wife and I have always valued vacations.  Before kids, we took our first cruise (in a very, very small cabin), spent a week in Cancun (the taxi driver called us the “loco americanos”), visited Reno, Portland, Vail, and Germany.  

As parents we have taken the kids all over the planet.  From Disney in Florida to Disney in Los Angeles.  From NYC to San Francisco.  We’ve traveled internationally: Australia, Paris, Mexico, Bahamas and Virgin Islands, and even Canada.  For us travel has always been an important experience.

For us, travel has always been an important and valuable experience.  That holds true today -- we still travel as a family of five occasionally.  Not often, but sometimes we can make it happen.  A couple of years ago we snorkeled as a family off the coast of Honduras -- and caught Covid together as an added surprise.

**Nerd Math**

Over the years I’ve developed a math formula for the complexity of travel (and of life in general really).  Here it is:

$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{N - 1}, \quad \text{where } N = \text{number of people}
$$

In this context complexity can mean several things.  Stress or cost or even just moments of “grumpiness”.

Let’s look at examples of how this works.  For instance if I travel alone for some reason (occasionally for business) then N = 1.  IN this case the formula says

$$
\text{N} = 1, \text{ (i.e. just me)} 
$$
$$
\text{Complexity} = 2^{(1) - 1} = 2^0 = 1 
$$
