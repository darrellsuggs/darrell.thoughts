If you have never been to GalaxyCon, you should go.  Trust me.

**Galaxy What?**

GalaxyCon is the eastern seaboard's version of the infamous San Diego "ComicCon". Nominally, an "Anime Convention", but that name doesn't do justice to the event.  It happens annually in late July in the Raleigh, NC convention center - a four day event.

The event is attended by thousands each day, young kids to the elderly.  It brings a large and diverse crowd. You really do have to see it to understand, but I'll explain what I can.

**What Is It - Really**

After several visits (ok, 3 or 4), I've come to better understand the outlines of the event.  I'll summarize.
- Celebritie Meet/Greet and Q&A
- Giant Market (Everything from real swords to custom artwork)
- Costume Contest (For yound and old)
- Cosplay Spectacle (You just have to see it to understand)

**Celebrities**

There are typically 50 or more celebrities.  Some well known actors, some voice actors, some wrestling personalities, and a whole host of voice and little known actors.

They each have a booth for autographs, selfies, and chatting.  In my experience most of them are just down to earth  people, basking in the glow of fans, chatting, signing, and smiling for photos with each fan.  And collecting a little money for the effort (typically $60 or so for a photo with the fan.)

I usually just cruise the rows, looking for people who I'm familiar with and then stealig a glance in real life.  Occasionally I'll walk up and chat briefly (if they are sitting idle).  Only twice have I paid for pictures. But it's an interesting group, lots of big screen movie stars as well as streaming and televison personalities.  I've seen everyone from Ric Flair (the wrestler) to Linda Hamilton (the woman in Terminator). Oddly enough, in real life, they typically look older and less glamorous -- natural I suppose. Just seeing them in real life is cool.

**Giant Market**

The convention center floor is turned into a humongous bazaar, cut into rows and columns.  The vendors sell a very diverse set of products.  There is a lot of artwork and posters.  Funko pops, trading cards, swords, pins, and a wide arrange of "toys" like Lego people and video game stuff.

There is also a large contingent of custom artists.  Graphic novelists, full fledged writers, and artists of all ilk's, from paitinings to incredible pencil stenciling.  After seeing what celebs are there, I usually walk each and every aisle looking at the merchandise (and the people).  I find the artists and writers are very approachable and quick to offer insight into their work.  I'm always fascinated with both the skill and mechanics needed to craft their art.  This year one guy pre-answered one of my most common questions by putting a sticker on each pencil drawing showing "Hours Invested". One drawing had 200 hours - that's five normal work weeks.  Custom artwork is clearly time consuming.

Over the time I've been going, I've noticed a shift away from some of the more well known themes (Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc) toward numerous (unrecognizable to me) variations of Asian and Anime. That said, if you need a full body Storm Trooper outfit, this is your place.

**Costume Contests**

**Cosplay Spectacle**

Let me explain cosplay this way.  Recall a time in life when you loved Halloween and creating the perfect costume to show off with your friends and neightbors was almost as exciting as Christmas. Now, become an adult, have a budget with real money, and build your perfect costume of your favorite character.  Now stroll around a building with thousands of other cosplay characters, taking pictures with them and sharing complements about the outfits.  Better yet, bump into someone dressed as you, fanboy and take pictures togther.  Again, I cannot overstate this part -- you just have to see some of these cosplay outfits in person.

**How Did I Get Here?**

I am not a Cosplayer -- didn't even know the word until a couple of years ago.

I'll confess that I have begun to enjoy the annual sojourn.

**Star Struck**

A couple of years back, my youngest and I paid to have a photo with Chrisotpher Lloyd (Doc Brown from Back to the Future -- an all=time favorite movie of mine.)  It was expensive and quick, but cool just to be there.

- princess peach
- lifesize and very realistic r2d2
- kid / guy from jurassic park
- sid kroft (creator of land of the lost -- one of my favorite saturday shows)

The highlight this year was when I also happened upon one of my favorite TV characters -- Data from Star Trek The Next Generation. We spoke for a while.  He was really laid back and funny actually.  I paid for a photo.  I asked AI to render it for me from the original.

**Lessons Learned**
- Occasionally, explore a subculture completely out of your wheel house
- Celebrities are just people too, most of the nice and down to earth
- Custom artwork is really interesting when the artist is standing in front of you
- Creativity and passion comes in many forms -- Cosplay is certainly one of those
