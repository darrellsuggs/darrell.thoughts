description: "At this point in life I have read just over 200 books.  This doesn't include partial reads like text books or other collections.  Two hundred real books.  From Star Wars: A New Hope to Leonardo Da Vinci's biography, with a healthy does of fantasy, sci-fi, self-help, and historical books.  Reading as an inside-my-head vacation is an incredible way to relax, learn, and prompt insightful thinking.  Let's talk about books, reading, and thinking."
